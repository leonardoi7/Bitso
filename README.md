## Design 

Opted for Realm as the database because had a short time to develop the project and I have experience with it and is only being used as a cache for the data, so I think it's the best option for this case, I would have used CoreData if I had more time to develop the project and if I had to use the database for more things than just caching the data.

Also, I used MVVM as architecture because it's the one I'm most familiar with and because is a small project, so I think it's the best option for this case.

Used SwiftUI for the UI because it allows me to develop the UI faster and I have experience with it.
